      <description>Hi everyone! Sorry for missing out on publishing individual blogs for 19th, 20th and 21st November, but it has been very hectic for me, and I decided to give leetcode a break and explore System Design (a lot). Turns out, I had some idea about it already, one of the advantages of working with startups (CareAI/Dukaan). But in any case, quite a few interesting things I learnt. I can&amp;rsquo;t share all the links, as it will be just better to share the playlists or YT channels I referred:</description>

      <description>Hi everyone, Day 5 of this series of daily updates. Started my day, fairly early but was feeling unwell. In any case, I did make some progress with my learning of the Interpreter. One of motivation to learn about Interpreter is to learn the whole process, from the code we write to the object files / executables. Of course, in this goal, my next step would be to read the &amp;ldquo;Write a compiler in Go&amp;rdquo; book.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone, Day 4 of this series of daily updates. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot to share today, just one of those days where I spent a lot of time going through whatever I&amp;rsquo;ve done already. I take some time to look at the things I learned so far, and see if I could be more intuitive back then. I&amp;rsquo;m going to continue doing the same for the next day, though this time for the problems I&amp;rsquo;ve solved on Leetcode.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone, Day 3 of this series of daily updates. Woke up fairly early (~6 AM), and started working. Though it seemed productive to me, but you won&amp;rsquo;t see a lot of content here today - just one of those days where I didn&amp;rsquo;t do a lot of different things, I guess. :)
Projects/Learning:
I made my rust-leetcode repository public today. It currently contains 12 solved problems, you&amp;rsquo;ll see huge difference between the first few codes to the last few codes.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone, Day 2 of this series of daily updates. Started my day earlier than yesterday, at around 9 AM (work).
Learning:
Watched this nice video from Jason on The Right Way to Write C++ in 2022: I like when he advocated on using different compilers, or at least verifying that it works for all (and if not, then you&amp;rsquo;re aware). Interest: take warnings seriously. Need to start doing it, I&amp;rsquo;ve been following this with Rust, but C++ never raised Rust-like &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; warnings.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone, I&amp;rsquo;m back to - writing daily update blogs. Just sharing what I did today, and documenting my progress. Now of course it won&amp;rsquo;t contain everything I do, but yep - everything related to learning and things I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about.
Reading
Just In Time Compilation (Wiki): Wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation Honestly, I wanted to start with a few papers on it, but Wikipedia does give enough background and sets some context. Leetcode problems</description>
