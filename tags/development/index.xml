      <description>Hi everyone!! I&amp;rsquo;ve an update, on what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to - and I&amp;rsquo;m excited. It&amp;rsquo;s a rusty update ðŸ˜‰. As always, I would love to tell you a story (this will help set some context), but if you want to skip and go directly to the update, please scroll to: # THE Update section.
The Story I&amp;rsquo;ve been through, possibly, the best and the worst time of my life. I use these contrasting words because everything went wrong - and that&amp;rsquo;s where you get an opportunity to shine.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone! In this blog, I will be discussing the algorithm used in Bismuth to find the closest relative window to be focused for focusWindowByDirection event. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the previous blog, make sure to give it a read here.
Recap from the previous blog Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a quick recap though, in the previous blog, we discussed:
focusWindowByDirection requires the following information:
 direction (from the user) - can be one of: right, left, top/up, bottom/down.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone! I understand it&amp;rsquo;s been a long time, and I&amp;rsquo;m so excited to be writing this blog today. In today&amp;rsquo;s blog, I wanted to talk about my journey (so far) on contributing to Bismuth (a KDE&amp;rsquo;s Tiling Window Manager Extension), mainly how and why I started, and where I am right now.
The Story: Why KDE Plasma and Why Bismuth? For the last few months (close to a year), I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Pop OS (a linux distribution by System 76) which had this amazing automatic tiling window extension called pop-shell, and it was close to what I always needed:</description>

      <description>Chapter 8: Common Collections These are my notes from the chapter-8 of rust book. Please scroll down to the bottom (Note) section if you are curious about what this is.
8.1: Storing Lists of Values with Vectors Vec&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; collection type discussed, aka vector: * By default contiguous. * All values should be of same type.
// Creation let v: Vec&amp;lt;i32&amp;gt; = Vec::new(); // vec! macro for convenience // default integer type is i32 let v = vec!</description>

      <description>Chapter 8: Common Collections (Hash Maps) In the previous blog, I shared my notes on strings and vectors in Rust, and in this post we&amp;rsquo;ll cover Hash Maps. I personally have found their use in competitive programming, a lot, but hopefully as we move on, we&amp;rsquo;ll see lots of use-cases in real-life problems.
Hash Maps Hash Maps: HashMap&amp;lt;K, V&amp;gt;
 You can&amp;rsquo;t access using indices, but through keys. Hash Maps store data on heap.</description>

      <description>NOTE
My notes on Chapter 3, Item 13 of Effective Modern C++ written by Scott Meyers.
Some (or even all) of the text can be similar to what you see in the book, as these are notes: I&amp;rsquo;ve tried not to be unnecessarily creative with my words. :)
 In C++, iterators come handy to point at memory addresses of STL containers. For example,
// C++11  std::vector&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; x {11, 9, 23, 6}; // begin() member function returns an iterator, which points to the first // memory address of the container x std::vector&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;::iterator it = x.</description>

 Overriding != Overloading
Example of virtual function overriding:
// Base class class Base { public: virtual void doWork(); // ... }; // Derived class from Base class Derived: public Base { public: // virtual is optional  // this will &amp;#34;override&amp;#34; Base::doWork  virtual void doWork(); // .</description>

      <description>Prefer deleted functions to private undefined ones This item (11) in the chapter 3 focuses on:
 Why and How to prevent users calling particular functions? C++-98 and C++-11 approach What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between deleting a function vs declaring a member function private (and not defining them)?   NOTE
These are my notes on Chapter 3, Item 11 of Effective Modern C++ written by Scott Meyers.

      <description>Scoped vs Unscoped Enums  General rule: declaring a name inside curly braces is limited to that scope. Exception: C++-98 style Enums   NOTE

      <description>Hi Everyone, today I want to talk about Union Find Problem. This is going to be a series covering:
 Union Find Problem (this blog) Solutions to Union Find (1): Quick Find Solutions to Union Find (2): Quick Union Solutions to Union Find (3): Weighted Quick Union Applications of Union Find (perculation and more) Cool project using Union Find Solving some competitive programming questions using Union Find  Each blog will try to cover very basic concepts behind the topic, and also what it&amp;rsquo;s all about.</description>
