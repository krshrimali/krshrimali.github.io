      <description>Hi everyone, so this week has been comparatively more productive in terms of learning as well as work! I&amp;rsquo;m happy, so why not share with everyone as well? &amp;#x1f389;&#xA;PyTorch: (ft. Quansight and Facebook)&#xA;Started working on porting index_add to structured kernels, see the PR I made on my forked repo here, and on upstream here. This included adding an out= variant to the op. Refining the way it&amp;rsquo;s registered in PyTorch.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone, before I go ahead and share my progress, I wanted to quickly talk about what this blog is about.&#xA;I am highly passionate with the idea of high performance computing, optimizing deep learning applications, and solving real world problems using deep learning, computer vision, and speech processing. While I&amp;rsquo;m on this path - I would like to document this somewhere. And while I&amp;rsquo;m doing that, why not share it publicly?</description>
