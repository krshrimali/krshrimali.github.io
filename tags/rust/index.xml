      <description>Hi everyone! Been a long time, thought I should talk about an ongoing project I&amp;rsquo;m working on.&#xA;Introduction - What are we trying to do here? Lemme start with some context and disclaimer first:&#xA;This was a part of an interview process in one of the amazing startups, and I wanted to extend it to an end-to-end project (kinda out of scope from the requirement of that interview process). I won&amp;rsquo;t be naming the startup here to help keep them anonymous and candid for their future candidates.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone!! I&amp;rsquo;ve an update, on what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to - and I&amp;rsquo;m excited. It&amp;rsquo;s a rusty update ðŸ˜‰. As always, I would love to tell you a story (this will help set some context), but if you want to skip and go directly to the update, please scroll to: # THE Update section.&#xA;The Story I&amp;rsquo;ve been through, possibly, the best and the worst time of my life. I use these contrasting words because everything went wrong - and that&amp;rsquo;s where you get an opportunity to shine.</description>

      <description>Chapter 8: Common Collections These are my notes from the chapter-8 of rust book. Please scroll down to the bottom (Note) section if you are curious about what this is.&#xA;8.1: Storing Lists of Values with Vectors Vec&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; collection type discussed, aka vector: * By default contiguous. * All values should be of same type.&#xA;// Creation let v: Vec&amp;lt;i32&amp;gt; = Vec::new(); // vec! macro for convenience // default integer type is i32 let v = vec!</description>

      <description>Chapter 8: Common Collections (Hash Maps) In the previous blog, I shared my notes on strings and vectors in Rust, and in this post we&amp;rsquo;ll cover Hash Maps. I personally have found their use in competitive programming, a lot, but hopefully as we move on, we&amp;rsquo;ll see lots of use-cases in real-life problems.&#xA;Hash Maps Hash Maps: HashMap&amp;lt;K, V&amp;gt;&#xA;You can&amp;rsquo;t access using indices, but through keys. Hash Maps store data on heap.</description>
