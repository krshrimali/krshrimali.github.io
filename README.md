This is where I dump all my thoughts, and learnings. No, not the repo but [here](https://krshrimali.github.io) :rocket:.

I'm working on the first release of the blog after 2 years, and here you go: https://github.com/krshrimali/krshrimali.github.io/milestone/1. 26th September is the due date, hoping to finish before that ;)
