      <description>Hi everyone, Day 3 of this series of daily updates. Woke up fairly early (~6 AM), and started working. Though it seemed productive to me, but you won&amp;rsquo;t see a lot of content here today - just one of those days where I didn&amp;rsquo;t do a lot of different things, I guess. :)
Projects/Learning:
 I made my rust-leetcode repository public today. It currently contains 12 solved problems, you&amp;rsquo;ll see huge difference between the first few codes to the last few codes.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone, Day 2 of this series of daily updates. Started my day earlier than yesterday, at around 9 AM (work).
Learning:
 Watched this nice video from Jason on The Right Way to Write C++ in 2022:  I like when he advocated on using different compilers, or at least verifying that it works for all (and if not, then you&amp;rsquo;re aware). Interest: take warnings seriously. Need to start doing it, I&amp;rsquo;ve been following this with Rust, but C++ never raised Rust-like &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; warnings.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone, I&amp;rsquo;m back to - writing daily update blogs. Just sharing what I did today, and documenting my progress. Now of course it won&amp;rsquo;t contain everything I do, but yep - everything related to learning and things I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about.
Reading
 Just In Time Compilation (Wiki):  Wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation Honestly, I wanted to start with a few papers on it, but Wikipedia does give enough background and sets some context.</description>
