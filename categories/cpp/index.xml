      <description>Hi everyone! In this blog, I will be discussing the algorithm used in Bismuth to find the closest relative window to be focused for focusWindowByDirection event. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the previous blog, make sure to give it a read here.
Recap from the previous blog Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a quick recap though, in the previous blog, we discussed:
focusWindowByDirection requires the following information:
direction (from the user) - can be one of: right, left, top/up, bottom/down.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone! I understand it&amp;rsquo;s been a long time, and I&amp;rsquo;m so excited to be writing this blog today. In today&amp;rsquo;s blog, I wanted to talk about my journey (so far) on contributing to Bismuth (a KDE&amp;rsquo;s Tiling Window Manager Extension), mainly how and why I started, and where I am right now.
The Story: Why KDE Plasma and Why Bismuth? For the last few months (close to a year), I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Pop OS (a linux distribution by System 76) which had this amazing automatic tiling window extension called pop-shell, and it was close to what I always needed:</description>

      <title>Prefer const_iterators to iterators (Notes)</title>

      <description>NOTE
My notes on Chapter 3, Item 13 of Effective Modern C++ written by Scott Meyers.
Some (or even all) of the text can be similar to what you see in the book, as these are notes: I&amp;rsquo;ve tried not to be unnecessarily creative with my words. :)
In C++, iterators come handy to point at memory addresses of STL containers. For example,
// C++11 std::vector&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; x {11, 9, 23, 6}; // begin() member function returns an iterator, which points to the first // memory address of the container x std::vector&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;::iterator it = x.</description>

Overriding != Overloading
Example of virtual function overriding:
// Base class class Base { public: virtual void doWork(); // ... }; // Derived class from Base class Derived: public Base { public: // virtual is optional // this will &amp;#34;override&amp;#34; Base::doWork virtual void doWork(); // .</description>

      <description>Prefer deleted functions to private undefined ones This item (11) in the chapter 3 focuses on:
Why and How to prevent users calling particular functions? C++-98 and C++-11 approach What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between deleting a function vs declaring a member function private (and not defining them)? NOTE
These are my notes on Chapter 3, Item 11 of Effective Modern C++ written by Scott Meyers.

      <description>Scoped vs Unscoped Enums General rule: declaring a name inside curly braces is limited to that scope. Exception: C++-98 style Enums NOTE

// You can&amp;#39;t declare black, white, red in the scope containing the enum Color enum Color { black, white, red; }; auto white = false; // error: white already declared in this scope Unscoped Enums have implicit type conversions for their enumerators.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s blog, we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about two important concepts in C++: Function Pointers and Function Objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that, function objects are commonly referred as &lt;em&gt;functors&lt;/em&gt; but we have failed to notice any official alias to the name. Hence, we&amp;rsquo;ll restrict ourselves to using &lt;em&gt;Function Objects&lt;/em&gt; in this blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understanding how Vectors work in C&#43;&#43; (Part-2): What happens when you initialize a vector?</title>

      <description>In the last blog post, I realized there were a lot of methods inherited from the base struct _Vector_base_ and _Vector_impl_data. Instead of directly going to the source code of these structs, I&amp;rsquo;ll go through their methods and objects by explaining what happens when we initialize a vector.
That is, we will start from calling a vector constructor and then see how memory is allocated. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t looked at the previous blog post, please take a look here.</description>
