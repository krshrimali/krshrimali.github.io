      <description>Hi everyone! Happy to be back, in case y&amp;rsquo;all have been wondering - where have you been Kush? Well, a lot of things have been happening on my YouTube channel and Twitch Channel - buffetcodes. But in any case, I wanted to write something out - so here it is.
Disclaimer: this is more on a personal level rather than on an educational level, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry to disappoint if you were expecting a detailed tech blog today.</description>
