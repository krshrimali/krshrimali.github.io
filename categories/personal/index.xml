      <description>&lt;p&gt;So this happened today, I was attempting a typing speed test on &lt;a href=&#34;https://monkeytype.com&#34;&gt;monkeytype&lt;/a&gt; and quickly realised a few things that kind of related in my personal life. Thought I&amp;rsquo;ll share with y&amp;rsquo;all and I&amp;rsquo;m confident you all will relate!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For context, I&amp;rsquo;ve been at around 120 wpm (avg) to 135 wpm (max) in a 30 seconds speed test for quite some time now (maybe more than a year at least). And very honestly, I&amp;rsquo;m happy about it, I don&amp;rsquo;t wwant to grow my typing speed further - in fact I never planned it before as well. I used to just type as fast as my fingers would allow, and turns out it was good enough for me to do my work. Right now, my goal is more towards sustaining my wrists and fingers along with work, as it definitely pains a lot if your positioning is not right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
