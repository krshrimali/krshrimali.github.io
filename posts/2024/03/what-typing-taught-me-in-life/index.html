        <p>So this happened today, I was attempting a typing speed test on <a href="https://monkeytype.com">monkeytype</a> and quickly realised a few things that kind of related in my personal life. Thought I&rsquo;ll share with y&rsquo;all and I&rsquo;m confident you all will relate!</p>
<p>For context, I&rsquo;ve been at around 120 wpm (avg) to 135 wpm (max) in a 30 seconds speed test for quite some time now (maybe more than a year at least). And very honestly, I&rsquo;m happy about it, I don&rsquo;t wwant to grow my typing speed further - in fact I never planned it before as well. I used to just type as fast as my fingers would allow, and turns out it was good enough for me to do my work. Right now, my goal is more towards sustaining my wrists and fingers along with work, as it definitely pains a lot if your positioning is not right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve moved to another city (temporarily, for personal reasons) and I&rsquo;m away from my beautiful (and sacred? idk, I just worship it a lot) setup, which also means that I haven&rsquo;t had time yet to stream/upload videos/write blogs. More on this in another blog maybe, but today I was just attempting a typing speed test. Initially, I was around 120, but in the next one, I scored 135. Screenshot attached below:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krshrimali/blog/main/assets/blogs/what-typing-taught-me-blog-ss.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I started thinking - what was different this time? Terrain? Keyboard? Hands? Person? Time? Nope! Luck? Maybe. But one thing stood out, I was reading the next word while I was typing the current one. I started off by reading 2 words, so I knew A and B, and when I would type B - I would already know it so I&rsquo;ll just end up reading C and so on. This gave me an idea, we perform better when we prepare ourselves for what&rsquo;s gonna happen in the next closest move, right? Yes, of course I &ldquo;knew&rdquo; what was the next word this time but that&rsquo;s an <em>effort</em> I made for myself to read what&rsquo;s going to happen next and prepare my fingers accordingly. Focus on the present, yes, but are you preparing yourself for the near future? Did you ever imagine what it would look like?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done this for some time now, whenever I&rsquo;ll go out running, or do any physical exercise - I would imagine myself being happy after I&rsquo;m done accomplishing my goal. Of course I won&rsquo;t be as built as others, but I accomplished something that I <em>planned</em>. And if I failed, I know what I missed out on. And that would help me push forward for being more disciplined and resilient next time.</p>
<p>The problem is, we don&rsquo;t even know what we are missing out on once we quit (anything). We realise it after a year or XYZ time - &ldquo;Oh, I missed out on this. Had I stayed longer, it would have worked&rdquo;. Also, this sounds like a relationship advice, right? Maybe it is then! You have a relationship with your city, your company, your friends, your partners, your parents and for nerds like me - keyboard, monitors, shoes, badminton gear and so on. I imagine myself without them and I know how important they are. I feel we should practice visualisation more often in life, it just helps&hellip; Just like it helped me push my typing speed to 135 from 120 wpm.</p>
<p>Felt like sharing this, so I did! Thank you for reading everyone, as always - I&rsquo;m grateful for all the love you&rsquo;ve given me in life.</p>
