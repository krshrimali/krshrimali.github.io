        <p>Alright, we are back. It&rsquo;s Saturday, so I spent a lot of time cleaning up my flat and my setup. Bengaluru is quite a dusty city, so yep, gotta clean regularly. Anyways, in terms of learning, my goals of today were to read some source code and papers/official documentation. It&rsquo;s been some time since I didn&rsquo;t do any Rust, so today I&rsquo;ll just touch upon that as well.</p>

<p>(New section: TODOs for tomorrow)</p>
<p>TODOs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explore HVM: <a href="https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/HVM">https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/HVM</a>, looks interesting at least.</li>
<li>Read through: <a href="https://hal.science/hal-03827702v2/document">Specifying and Verifying Higher-order Rust Iterators</a>.</li>
<li>Read through: <a href="https://bertptrs.nl/2023/04/27/how-does-async-rust-work.html">How does async rust work</a></li>
<li>Continue working on the micro project.</li>
<li>Record a video for YouTube!</li>
