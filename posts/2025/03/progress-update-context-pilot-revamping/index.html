        <p>I&rsquo;ve had many iterations on this project that I&rsquo;m going to talk about today, over the last 1.5-2 years. There are good and bad things about it. Good is that I&rsquo;m persisting with completing it one day, bad is that I&rsquo;ve not done it yet.</p>
<p>In this blog, I&rsquo;ll quickly touch upon why it has taken so much time and what&rsquo;s happening behind the scenes.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-project">About the project:</h2>
<p>For a piece of code, this project is going to help you with questions like:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is this logic tested?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Which other features does this logic mostly pair with?&rdquo;
&ldquo;What other things are dependent on this logic?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Who is the right person to reach out to, for any queries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hope these points are enough motivation for someone to understand the importance of this project.</p>
<h2 id="progress">Progress:</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a <a href="https://github.com/krshrimali/context-pilot-rs">working model</a> in 2023 when I started, and plugins ready for <a href="https://github.com/krshrimali/context-pilot.nvim">neovim</a> and <a href="https://github.com/krshrimali/context-pilot-vscode">vscode</a> but I realized this project - for a better direction - needs to act like an LSP. Do a lot of async work, like indexing, and make sure results are quicker and reliable.</p>
<p>Now, converting the initial binary code into server, wasn&rsquo;t easy at all, for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I started with a simple JSON as the DB, for initial PoC. JSON is not scalable, but that wasn&rsquo;t the bottleneck back then. Bottelneck was reading a huge JSON file - so the immediate solution was to use DB Sharding concept - divide your huge file into chunks, and know which one to read when a user queries.</li>
<li>Making this a proper async server hasn&rsquo;t been easy. Rust (or for that matter, any language) async programming comes with its own debugging issues, and complex code. I&rsquo;ve had to rewrite the codebase several times to make it work.</li>
</ol>
<p>And of course, apart from the technical excuses, there has been life:</p>
<ol>
<li>Work has kept me very busy, for good. Of course, no excuses but that&rsquo;s what pays me and I like being religious towards it - so yep, I enjoy spending most of my time there.</li>
<li>Saturation - Of course, working on a single thing for 2 years can get tiring. I&rsquo;ve had some other projects picked up, and targeting physical fitness as well, so yes - I&rsquo;ve not really spent 2 years on this project only :D obviously!</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyways, there is some motivation again to help finish this. Mostly for the reasons that I want to use it personally, and I think it is going to be of huge help to me at work and personally as well.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to revamp this whole project. The way it was designed before, doesn&rsquo;t seem right to me anymore. I think I had too many API details exposed on the Database level for the sake of making it work:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As you can already see, this is just too much detail for - even me to understand after some time. I know, at some point of time, even if this works, I&rsquo;m going to face the issue of &ldquo;Wait, what does this mean? Why did I write it?&rdquo;. So, better fix it now. It&rsquo;s also a code quality thing I&rsquo;ve in mind that I hate debugging things further. I&rsquo;ve had some luck while fixing <a href="https://github.com/krshrimali/context-pilot-rs/commit/d0aa6bea5c0ed0101c2b37c3ac30b6f959ba8aa7">here</a> where I was at least able to find the bug, but then fixing it would just need me to fix the DB asynchronous writing and reading.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not ergonomic for me and the readers as well to look at the piece of code in the current state and understand what caused what :)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll share more technical details in the next blog, but for now, this would be it.</p>
