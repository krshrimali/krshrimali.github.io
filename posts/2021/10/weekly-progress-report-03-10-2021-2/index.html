PyTorch: (ft. Quansight and Facebook)
Started working on porting index_add to structured kernels, see the PR I made on my forked repo here, and on upstream here. This included adding an out= variant to the op. Refining the way it&rsquo;s registered in PyTorch. I am thinking to pass defalut value while registering, but it will be a BC breaking change. Finally got to use ghstack, thanks to Yukio (Quansight). Revised derivatives yaml file. Personally I feel that this one needs opinions from the Facebook team, and a lot of changes might be rejected (which is okay, at the end of the day - everything we do should be good for the library). My PR here is more like a prototype for everyone to get a chance to review, as well as comment on what they feel. Structured Kernel porting PR for baddbmm, bmm has been merged. Yay! &#x1f389; &#x2764;&#xfe0f; PR. Took a walkthrough of lots of autogenerated code in PyTorch, to understand how ops are registered. Listened to Ed&rsquo;s podcast - episode on NVIDIA GPUs. A sweet little introduction to NVIDIA GPUs. Extras:

        <p>Hi everyone, so this week has been comparatively more productive in terms of learning as well as work! I&rsquo;m happy, so why not share with everyone as well? &#x1f389;</p>
<p><strong>PyTorch</strong>: (ft. Quansight and Facebook)</p>
<ul>
<li>Started working on porting <code>index_add</code> to structured kernels, see the PR I made on my forked repo <a href="https://github.com/krshrimali/pytorch/pull/14">here</a>, and on upstream <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/65993">here</a>.

</ul>

<li>Structured Kernel porting PR for <code>baddbmm, bmm</code> has been merged. Yay! &#x1f389; &#x2764;&#xfe0f; <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/65993">PR</a>.</li>

<li>Listened to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6UzHKeiy368jKfQMKKvJY5">Ed&rsquo;s podcast</a> - episode on NVIDIA GPUs. A sweet little introduction to NVIDIA GPUs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Extras</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continued reading history of JIT, but couldn&rsquo;t complete it. :sad: Will have to continue reading the next week, find the link <a href="http://eecs.ucf.edu/~dcm/Teaching/COT4810-Spring2011/Literature/JustInTimeCompilation.pdf">here</a>.</li>
<li>Effective Modern C++: I finished reading Item 14 of Chapter 3, but couldn&rsquo;t write notes about it. This blog post, I&rsquo;m planning to discuss the intermediate generated code (closer to assembly), so let&rsquo;s see how that goes the next week.</li>
<li>Learnt a bit about compilers, started reading a book on it.</li>
<li>Wrote a shell script in case I distro hop a lot, will link on this later once I&rsquo;ve uploaded it.</li>
<li>Started going through NumPy&rsquo;s source code, just something I&rsquo;m doing for learning.</li>
<li>Reading about memory overlaps in C.</li>
<li>BuffetCodes organization was dissolved recently, and the repositories were transferred. Thanks to my friend (Himanshu Singh) on working with me on this, it was a great experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m continuously thinking if writing this is anyway helpful for anyone else, so yes - please do let me know if you like reading these. However, I&rsquo;m enjoying learning and I think that&rsquo;s all that matters. I plan to start new projects very soon, and hopefully that should go good.</p>
