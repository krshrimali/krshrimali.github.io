It’s Saturday, so I spent a lot of time cleaning up my flat and my setup. Bengaluru is quite a dusty city, so yep, gotta clean regularly. Anyways, in terms of learning, my goals of today were to read some source code and papers/official documentation. It’s been some time since I didn’t do any Rust, so today I’ll just touch upon that as well.
Rust - building a UI to plot a sensor in real time Why this? I’ve used Iced library quite a bit so far, so wanted to understand how other UI libraries look like. I’m not going for the “famous” libraries here, just wanted to experience any other library. Plus, this video seemed to be decent and technically focused enough on the implementation. Setting up PostgreSQL server on my system: Why this? For me to start working on some projects of my own, it’s important to setup stage for them. Notes: I used this blog by digital ocean as reference. Micro Project: Store all the key presses in a server Notes: Since I type a lot, everyone does, the DB will have to be good enough. I wanted to see how I can enable indexing and searching, this will help give me an idea. No UI stuff right now. Maybe one day. NeoVim Config: I was randomly trying a keymap, and I just remembered I had &lt;leader>nf for SnipRun. And oh, wow - it finally made sense why it could be useful. Selecting text, code block, displaying output in the command window or as virtual text (different highlight for errors) and even in a vertical split terminal, amazing stuff! Something my nvim-autorunner was trying to do, cool stuff. Oh, and on another note: I watched a movie (after a long long time). Had to find time to relax a bit.

(Note: these blogs are mostly around my personal learning updates, so I’ll mostly miss anything that I do at work as that’s confidential)
What is OSI Model | Real World Examples Why this? The answer to: “How does the communication work from client to server” is very important in backend. I wanted to see if I missed anything from my graduate studies, but nothing much. This was more like a refresher. Notes: Each operating system has their own implementation of TCP protocol. Linux has it’s own for example, and it’s open sourced. Can take a look at TCP’s source code in Linux source code to understand how checksum correction works. Cloud load balancers: L4 Load Balancer (operates at TCP Level), L7 Load Balnacer (operates at Application Protocol Layer - HTTP/HTTPS) Postgres: Architectural Fundamentals Why this? Going through database design and architectural fundamentals is helpful. I plan to explore CockroachDB soon, but wanted to get some idea about the ones I’ve used so far (Postgres for example) Notes: Uses client/server model. PostgreSQL session consists following processes: Server: manages DB files, accepts connections to the DB from client apps, performs DB actions on behalf of clients. DB server process is called postgres Client (frontend): app that wants to perform DB operations. Client/server could be on diff hosts: communicate over TCP/IP n/w connection postgres can handle multiple connections from clients: Forks a new process for each connection The new process and client directly communicate No intervention of postgres server Supervisor server process is always running (daemon process), waiting for client connections Client and child server process can come and go PostgreSQL System Architecture Why this? Just wanted to explore another blog on the same topic to see if I missed anything. Tbh, nothing much. Notes: PostgreSQL: process-per-transaction model postgres server process: Managed by postmaster, central coordinating process Responsibilities: Initializing, terminating the server Handling connection requests from the new clients Recovery Run background processes Shared Memory: Reserved for DB caching and Transactional Log Caching Shared Disk Buffer Shared Tables Uses same set of tables to host multiple client data (TODO: how?) Backend Processes: Client interacts with backend processes (submits queries and receiving queries result) Multiple backend servers executing queries concurrently Each backend server: will handle only a single query at a time access data from main memory buffer pool (placed in shared memory) Thank you! :) See y’all in the next blog.

As always, I would love to tell you a story (this will help set some context), but if you want to skip and go directly to the update, please scroll to: # THE Update section.
The Story I’ve been through, possibly, the best and the worst time of my life. I use these contrasting words because everything went wrong - and that’s where you get an opportunity to shine. I think I fairly enjoyed resisting the pain and fighting through the odds, hopefully you’ll learn about it very soon on my blog (just need the courage to say it out loud :)).

One of motivation to learn about Interpreter is to learn the whole process, from the code we write to the object files / executables. Of course, in this goal, my next step would be to read the “Write a compiler in Go” book. But one step at a time, right?

Projects/Learning:
I made my rust-leetcode repository public today. It currently contains 12 solved problems, you’ll see huge difference between the first few codes to the last few codes. I’ve been learning, please don’t refer it for learning. I’m just documenting it there. Autogenerate README once a new file is added to my Rust Leetcode repository: I first started with writing a Python script to auto-generate the README.md file, from the modules registered in the src/lib.rs. The script is here. Since I wanted to explore how it can be done in Rust, I ported it to Rust as well. The script is here. Took some break from doing leetcode today, had a lot of work which I unfortunately can’t mention here.

Started my day earlier than yesterday, at around 9 AM (work).
Learning:
Watched this nice video from Jason on The Right Way to Write C++ in 2022: I like when he advocated on using different compilers, or at least verifying that it works for all (and if not, then you’re aware). Interest: take warnings seriously. Need to start doing it, I’ve been following this with Rust, but C++ never raised Rust-like “good enough” warnings. Might as well start doing it now. Code coverage analysis: hmm, it used to stay at around 87 to 90% for the libraries I worked with. I agree, most of it should be tested, but as the library grows longer, you can’t block PRs on coverage (specially by the community). But it’s underrated, I’ve seen developers ignore it until they face the wrath of weird bugs. 100% testing coverage, will always be difficult, but if the goal is kept in that direction, it might reach to 95-100%. Never heard of fuzz testing before…after reading about it, just another word of what we have done before. Never got a name to it though. ;) Ship with Hardening Enabled: Again, no idea about this. I’ll have to read about it. Marked as a TODO. Missed watching Edward’s stream on TorchDynamo, I woke up late. :/ Going to re-watch the stream now. I’ll share the notes in a separate blog once I’m done, I could only watch some of it today. I’ve started learning Kernel Fusion, how does it work and why it can help (and when it can not). This is going to be a long road, hopefully I’ll be able to share something concrete soon. Leetcode Problems:
