<meta name="description" content="Hi everyone, Day 3 of this series of daily updates. Woke up fairly early (~6 AM), and started working. Though it seemed productive to me, but you won&rsquo;t see a lot of content here today - just one of those days where I didn&rsquo;t do a lot of different things, I guess. :)
Projects/Learning:
I made my rust-leetcode repository public today. It currently contains 12 solved problems, you&rsquo;ll see huge difference between the first few codes to the last few codes. I&rsquo;ve been learning, please don&rsquo;t refer it for learning. I&rsquo;m just documenting it there. Autogenerate README once a new file is added to my Rust Leetcode repository: I first started with writing a Python script to auto-generate the README.md file, from the modules registered in the src/lib.rs. The script is here. Since I wanted to explore how it can be done in Rust, I ported it to Rust as well. The script is here. Took some break from doing leetcode today, had a lot of work which I unfortunately can&rsquo;t mention here.
