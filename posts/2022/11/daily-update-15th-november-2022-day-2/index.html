Learning:
Watched this nice video from Jason on The Right Way to Write C&#43;&#43; in 2022: I like when he advocated on using different compilers, or at least verifying that it works for all (and if not, then you&rsquo;re aware). Interest: take warnings seriously. Need to start doing it, I&rsquo;ve been following this with Rust, but C&#43;&#43; never raised Rust-like &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; warnings. Might as well start doing it now. Code coverage analysis: hmm, it used to stay at around 87 to 90% for the libraries I worked with. I agree, most of it should be tested, but as the library grows longer, you can&rsquo;t block PRs on coverage (specially by the community). But it&rsquo;s underrated, I&rsquo;ve seen developers ignore it until they face the wrath of weird bugs. 100% testing coverage, will always be difficult, but if the goal is kept in that direction, it might reach to 95-100%. Never heard of fuzz testing before&hellip;after reading about it, just another word of what we have done before. Never got a name to it though. ;) Ship with Hardening Enabled: Again, no idea about this. I&rsquo;ll have to read about it. Marked as a TODO. Missed watching Edward&rsquo;s stream on TorchDynamo, I woke up late. :/ Going to re-watch the stream now. I&rsquo;ll share the notes in a separate blog once I&rsquo;m done, I could only watch some of it today. I&rsquo;ve started learning Kernel Fusion, how does it work and why it can help (and when it can not). This is going to be a long road, hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to share something concrete soon.

        <p>Hi everyone, Day 2 of this series of daily updates. Started my day earlier than yesterday, at around 9 AM (work).</p>
<p><strong>Learning</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watched this nice video from Jason on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7Gv4J3FyYE">The Right Way to Write C++ in 2022</a>:
<ul>
<li>I like when he advocated on using different compilers, or at least verifying that it works for all (and if not, then you&rsquo;re aware).</li>
<li>Interest: take warnings seriously. Need to start doing it, I&rsquo;ve been following this with Rust, but C++ never raised Rust-like &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; warnings. Might as well start doing it now.</li>
<li>Code coverage analysis: hmm, it used to stay at around 87 to 90% for the libraries I worked with.

<li>Ship with Hardening Enabled: Again, no idea about this. I&rsquo;ll have to read about it. Marked as a TODO.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Missed watching Edward&rsquo;s stream on TorchDynamo, I woke up late. :/ Going to re-watch the stream now. I&rsquo;ll share the notes in a separate blog once I&rsquo;m done, I could only watch <em>some</em> of it today.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve started learning Kernel Fusion, how does it work and why it can help (and when it can not). This is going to be a long road, hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to share something concrete soon.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Leetcode Problems</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters">Longest substring without repeating characters</a></li>
<li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph">Clone graph</a>
<ul>
<li>Note: this was done in C++, Leetcode didn&rsquo;t have Rust added as the supported language for this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/">Product of Array Except Self</a>
I&rsquo;m still learning Rust, so it takes some time for me to write the <em>best</em> Rust versions of the codes above, but yeah - doing it the best way I can. I don&rsquo;t want to rush completing tens of problems in a day, to me - that doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ending-words">Ending Words</h2>
<p>Felt better as I am slowly collecting myself together. It&rsquo;s going to take some time though, but I aim to be consistent with the things I love doing.</p>
