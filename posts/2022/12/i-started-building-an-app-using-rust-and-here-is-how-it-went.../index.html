        <p>Hi everyone!! I&rsquo;ve an update, on what I&rsquo;ve been up to - and I&rsquo;m excited. It&rsquo;s a <em>rusty</em> update 😉. As always, I would love to tell you a story (this will help set some context), but if you want to skip and go directly to the update, please scroll to: <code># THE Update</code> section.</p>
<h2 id="the-story">The Story</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been through, possibly, the best and the worst time of my life. I use these contrasting words because everything went wrong - and that&rsquo;s where you get an opportunity to shine. I think I fairly enjoyed resisting the pain and fighting through the odds, hopefully you&rsquo;ll learn about it very soon on my blog (just need the courage to say it out loud :)).</p>
<p>Anyways, just when the life hit extreme low, I had two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cry about it, not for a day, but keep crying about it.</li>
<li>Accept, and do something that I enjoy.</li>
</ol>
<p>I chose a mix of both 1 and 2. Cried for a day or two, but then accepted and started diverting my energy to the things I imagined myself doing. One of those, which I can share here, was finishing up my dream side projects. To name a few:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/krshrimali/interpreter-go">Completing the book: Writing Interpreter in Go</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/krshrimali/rust-leetcode">Do some leetcode to gain confidence</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/krshrimali/CPP-File-Manager">Release the next version of C++ File Manager</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Write an App in Rust</strong>
and more&hellip;</li>
</ol>
<p>The 4th point you&rsquo;re looking at, is exactly what we are going to cover today.</p>
<h2 id="the-update">THE Update</h2>
<p>Here it comes! For those who (very kindly) follow <a href="https://youtube.com/c/kushashwaraviShrimali">my YouTube channel</a>, know already that I&rsquo;ve been learning Rust for a while. And while I was at it, I found it a good time to start building something. Pop! OS, the best Linux distribution I&rsquo;ve ever come across, announced their new Cosmic Desktop Environment a while back (it&rsquo;s a work in progress). I like reading source codes, and have been following what they were doing with Cosmic and remembered that they were using <a href="https://github.com/iced-rs/iced">Iced Library</a> for the development (GUI). I thought to give it a try, and the best place to start with, was the <a href="https://github.com/krshrimali/youtuber-monitoring-app">YouTube Monitoring App</a> which I was building earlier with Python and Electron JS. Porting the idea to Rust was comparatively easier than to think of another project.</p>
<p>Before I proceed, feel free to check out the repository <a href="https://github.com/krshrimali/YouTube-Monitoring-App-Rust-Iced">here</a>. It would be already outdated for this blog, but nonetheless - I hope you like the work.</p>
<p>So the journey took off, started with going through the examples, and the <a href="https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/tree/master/examples/styling"><code>styling</code></a> example. Seeing how theme is switched, was mesmerizing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I started, taking the first steps, just replicating the <code>styling</code> example to see if I can reproduce and understand what they were doing. As the time passed by, things started to take a good look:</p>
<ol>
<li>Theme switching was enabled.</li>
<li>Each user had a card (but not aligned 😢).</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Stage - 1" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krshrimali/blog/main/assets/blogs/rust_app_stage_first.png"></p>
<p><img alt="Stage - 1 (Light Theme)" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krshrimali/blog/main/assets/blogs/rust_app_stage_first_light.png"></p>
<p>The ideal stage would be to see the YouTube API collect details, create the JSON file, and show it to the user. I knew I was not even close to the final goal, but why give up?</p>
<p>Anyways, my next target was to figure out having a grid - multiple rows and multiple columns. From what I know, there isn&rsquo;t a <code>grid</code> like implementation within Iced, so I had to use <code>Column</code> and <code>Row</code> classes from Iced. It was tricky, if I have to be very honest, but finally worked out. Had to ask a couple of questions on the discord channel of Iced, they were very kind and quick to help me with my queries.</p>
<p>I also had to choose an image for each user, as an avatar was necessary. Once added, I knew it will start looking better. A header and a footer were also required, to give the user some info about what they are seeing on the screen. However, when the grid wasn&rsquo;t full, the image wouldn&rsquo;t align and that was an issue to resolve for the next stage.</p>
<p>Adding the avatar was very interesting, I wanted a link to work (for the avatar). But for now, I thought I&rsquo;ll suffice to using an image path to see if it really works (spoiler: it did 😄):</p>

<p>As I knew things were starting to take place, the next important step was to fix the alignment, and enable JSON parsing. Let me show you the issue we had with alignment:</p>
<p><img alt="Stage - 2 (alignment issue)" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krshrimali/blog/main/assets/blogs/rust_app_stage_second_alignment_issue.png"></p>
<p>The alignment issue was fixed with using <code>align_items</code> and also avoiding <code>width(Length::Fill)</code> with the user cards. We&rsquo;ll discuss these details in the next blog, for now, I just shared to give you a hint.</p>
<p>For JSON parsing, to start with, I created a <a href="https://github.com/krshrimali/YouTube-Monitoring-App-Rust-Iced/blob/main/list_users.json">sample JSON file</a>, and used <a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/json"><code>serde</code></a> crate to parse JSON file. The way a JSON can be deserialized into a JSON class, was amazing to see - very intuitive.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you have not noticed already, focus on the <code>u.slice_to(MAX_EXPECTED_ITEMS)</code> expression. While this isn&rsquo;t really useful right now (more on this later), but it was a good practice to implement. This basically answers: &ldquo;What if there is more data then the grid limit?&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s say the JSON file contains the data for 13 users, but our grid could only have 12 users&rsquo; data -&gt; in this case, <code>.slice_to</code> will make sure that we only use maximum of 12 users on the grid:</p>

<p>One of the very important step was to enable passing a link for the image/avatar. This was made possible using <code>reqwest</code> crate, getting the image in a form of bytes array and then converting it to an <code>image::Handle</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>The alignment was fixed</li>
<li>Image links were working</li>
<li>JSON parsing was done correctly</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BUT</strong> there was a small but significantly major mistake I made. Let&rsquo;s keep it for later though, keep reading ❤️</p>
<p><img alt="Stage - 3" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krshrimali/blog/main/assets/blogs/rust_app_stage_third.png"></p>
<p>Starting from here, you&rsquo;ll understand how important development is. In this stage, the UI won&rsquo;t change <em>BUT</em> we&rsquo;ll be significantly improving the performance.</p>
<p>So, while I was very happy about the project progress so far, I thought I&rsquo;ll ask my friend to open it up on his system. He had Windows, but fortunately he also had WSL. Thanks to him, he didn&rsquo;t give up on trying to run GUI on his WSL - and when finally the app loaded, it was <em>LAGGING</em>. &#x1f622;</p>
<p>I was surprised, because on my Mac - it was working fine. I opened up my Linux system, and guess what? It lagged there as well. I immediately knew I was doing something wrong. Now, as developers, we generally try to get to the bottleneck of the issue, and I had an instinct about it.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Just observe, that I was calling <code>profile_pic</code> method with the avatar link - which means that every time the theme is switched, the images will be fetched again. Wow! That&rsquo;s the only bottleneck? Nope!</p>
<p>Surprise! There is one more, we were actually reading the JSON file in the <code>view</code> function as well. Which was bad! So we finally have 2 bottlenecks for the performance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Downloading avatar link to an image handle.</li>
<li>Parsing and deserializing the JSON file to <code>YTCreator</code> struct.</li>
</ol>
<p>(Also thanks to the iced community on discord, who helped with the first point above. They were really helpful.)</p>
<p>Solving both bottlenecks above was intuitive to me. We could parse the JSON file as well as download the avatars when the app is created, for now. Later on, we&rsquo;ll do it when the user has changed inputs for the YT users they want to monitor. Here is how I solved it:</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#75715e">// Because dark as default is cool :D

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As you can see above^, we have <code>json_obj, loaded_photos</code> as two added fields to the <code>YTMonitor</code> struct. We parsed the JSON file as well as downloaded all the avatars (we already know the avatar links from the JSON file). Later on, I would just use these as <code>self.json_obj</code> and <code>self.image_handles</code> in the <code>view</code> function, so no more performance degradation!</p>

<p>I know this doesn&rsquo;t look the best yet, there are so many good apps out there built on the top of Iced, but I&rsquo;m getting started. Once this is done, I know at least - I - would love it. ❤️</p>
<p>Here is how the app looks like, right now (featuring my friend Mohit Wankhade 😃):</p>
