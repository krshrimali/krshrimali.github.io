      <description>Hi everyone! Over the last few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve received a lot of queries regarding applying to research internships. And I wanted to answer them shortly, in this blog, with a disclaimer to begin with.
DISCLAIMER
I did only one research internship (NTU Singapore, ROSE Labs), and there are people who are more qualified than me to answer this, but I&amp;rsquo;ll make my best attempt.
Here is how I will suggest to apply:</description>

      <description>Hi everyone! In this blog, I will be discussing the algorithm used in Bismuth to find the closest relative window to be focused for focusWindowByDirection event. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the previous blog, make sure to give it a read here.
Recap from the previous blog Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a quick recap though, in the previous blog, we discussed:
focusWindowByDirection requires the following information:
 direction (from the user) - can be one of: right, left, top/up, bottom/down.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone! I understand it&amp;rsquo;s been a long time, and I&amp;rsquo;m so excited to be writing this blog today. In today&amp;rsquo;s blog, I wanted to talk about my journey (so far) on contributing to Bismuth (a KDE&amp;rsquo;s Tiling Window Manager Extension), mainly how and why I started, and where I am right now.
The Story: Why KDE Plasma and Why Bismuth? For the last few months (close to a year), I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Pop OS (a linux distribution by System 76) which had this amazing automatic tiling window extension called pop-shell, and it was close to what I always needed:</description>

      <description>Chapter 8: Common Collections These are my notes from the chapter-8 of rust book. Please scroll down to the bottom (Note) section if you are curious about what this is.
8.1: Storing Lists of Values with Vectors Vec&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; collection type discussed, aka vector: * By default contiguous. * All values should be of same type.
// Creation let v: Vec&amp;lt;i32&amp;gt; = Vec::new(); // vec! macro for convenience // default integer type is i32 let v = vec!</description>

      <description>Chapter 8: Common Collections (Hash Maps) In the previous blog, I shared my notes on strings and vectors in Rust, and in this post we&amp;rsquo;ll cover Hash Maps. I personally have found their use in competitive programming, a lot, but hopefully as we move on, we&amp;rsquo;ll see lots of use-cases in real-life problems.
Hash Maps Hash Maps: HashMap&amp;lt;K, V&amp;gt;
 You can&amp;rsquo;t access using indices, but through keys. Hash Maps store data on heap.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone, so this week has been comparatively more productive in terms of learning as well as work! I&amp;rsquo;m happy, so why not share with everyone as well? ðŸŽ‰
PyTorch: (ft. Quansight and Facebook)
 Started working on porting index_add to structured kernels, see the PR I made on my forked repo here, and on upstream here.  This included adding an out= variant to the op. Refining the way it&amp;rsquo;s registered in PyTorch.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone, before I go ahead and share my progress, I wanted to quickly talk about what this blog is about.
I am highly passionate with the idea of high performance computing, optimizing deep learning applications, and solving real world problems using deep learning, computer vision, and speech processing. While I&amp;rsquo;m on this path - I would like to document this somewhere. And while I&amp;rsquo;m doing that, why not share it publicly?</description>

      <description>NOTE
My notes on Chapter 3, Item 13 of Effective Modern C++ written by Scott Meyers.
Some (or even all) of the text can be similar to what you see in the book, as these are notes: I&amp;rsquo;ve tried not to be unnecessarily creative with my words. :)
 In C++, iterators come handy to point at memory addresses of STL containers. For example,
// C++11  std::vector&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; x {11, 9, 23, 6}; // begin() member function returns an iterator, which points to the first // memory address of the container x std::vector&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;::iterator it = x.</description>

 Overriding != Overloading
Example of virtual function overriding:
// Base class class Base { public: virtual void doWork(); // ... }; // Derived class from Base class Derived: public Base { public: // virtual is optional  // this will &amp;#34;override&amp;#34; Base::doWork  virtual void doWork(); // .</description>

      <description>Prefer deleted functions to private undefined ones This item (11) in the chapter 3 focuses on:
 Why and How to prevent users calling particular functions? C++-98 and C++-11 approach What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between deleting a function vs declaring a member function private (and not defining them)?   NOTE
These are my notes on Chapter 3, Item 11 of Effective Modern C++ written by Scott Meyers.
