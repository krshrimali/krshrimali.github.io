      <description>Hi everyone!! I&amp;rsquo;ve an update, on what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to - and I&amp;rsquo;m excited. It&amp;rsquo;s a rusty update ðŸ˜‰. As always, I would love to tell you a story (this will help set some context), but if you want to skip and go directly to the update, please scroll to: # THE Update section.
The Story I&amp;rsquo;ve been through, possibly, the best and the worst time of my life. I use these contrasting words because everything went wrong - and that&amp;rsquo;s where you get an opportunity to shine.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone! Sorry for missing out on publishing individual blogs for 19th, 20th and 21st November, but it has been very hectic for me, and I decided to give leetcode a break and explore System Design (a lot). Turns out, I had some idea about it already, one of the advantages of working with startups (CareAI/Dukaan). But in any case, quite a few interesting things I learnt. I can&amp;rsquo;t share all the links, as it will be just better to share the playlists or YT channels I referred:</description>

      <description>Hi everyone, Day 5 of this series of daily updates. Started my day, fairly early but was feeling unwell. In any case, I did make some progress with my learning of the Interpreter. One of motivation to learn about Interpreter is to learn the whole process, from the code we write to the object files / executables. Of course, in this goal, my next step would be to read the &amp;ldquo;Write a compiler in Go&amp;rdquo; book.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone, Day 4 of this series of daily updates. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot to share today, just one of those days where I spent a lot of time going through whatever I&amp;rsquo;ve done already. I take some time to look at the things I learned so far, and see if I could be more intuitive back then. I&amp;rsquo;m going to continue doing the same for the next day, though this time for the problems I&amp;rsquo;ve solved on Leetcode.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone, Day 3 of this series of daily updates. Woke up fairly early (~6 AM), and started working. Though it seemed productive to me, but you won&amp;rsquo;t see a lot of content here today - just one of those days where I didn&amp;rsquo;t do a lot of different things, I guess. :)
Projects/Learning:
I made my rust-leetcode repository public today. It currently contains 12 solved problems, you&amp;rsquo;ll see huge difference between the first few codes to the last few codes.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone, Day 2 of this series of daily updates. Started my day earlier than yesterday, at around 9 AM (work).
Learning:
Watched this nice video from Jason on The Right Way to Write C++ in 2022: I like when he advocated on using different compilers, or at least verifying that it works for all (and if not, then you&amp;rsquo;re aware). Interest: take warnings seriously. Need to start doing it, I&amp;rsquo;ve been following this with Rust, but C++ never raised Rust-like &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; warnings.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone, I&amp;rsquo;m back to - writing daily update blogs. Just sharing what I did today, and documenting my progress. Now of course it won&amp;rsquo;t contain everything I do, but yep - everything related to learning and things I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about.
Reading
Just In Time Compilation (Wiki): Wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation Honestly, I wanted to start with a few papers on it, but Wikipedia does give enough background and sets some context. Leetcode problems</description>

      <description>Hi everyone! Over the last few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve received a lot of queries regarding applying to research internships. And I wanted to answer them shortly, in this blog, with a disclaimer to begin with.
DISCLAIMER
I did only one research internship (NTU Singapore, ROSE Labs), and there are people who are more qualified than me to answer this, but I&amp;rsquo;ll make my best attempt.
Here is how I will suggest to apply:</description>

      <description>Hi everyone! In this blog, I will be discussing the algorithm used in Bismuth to find the closest relative window to be focused for focusWindowByDirection event. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the previous blog, make sure to give it a read here.
Recap from the previous blog Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a quick recap though, in the previous blog, we discussed:
focusWindowByDirection requires the following information:
direction (from the user) - can be one of: right, left, top/up, bottom/down.</description>
