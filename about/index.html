<p>I try going live on my <a href="https://youtube.com/c/kushashwaraviShrimali">YouTube channel</a> whenever I find the time. Most of my projects and work are demonstrated there, in case it interests you! :)</p>
<p>Over the weekends - I contribute to open source, and write blogs (where you are right now). But that&rsquo;s not it, I like singing (not that I sing well xD), dancing on any random music I like and discussing technology (mostly Linux, vim, and programming) &amp; politics.</p>
<p>I love writing impactful codes! My work doesn&rsquo;t stop at getting the accuracy. I love optimizing the models to help deploy in real-time.</p>
